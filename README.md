# **Overview** #
**LangGraph** is a Python framework for designing and managing the flow of tasks in your application using graph structures. This course demonstrates **LangGraph** concepts through step-by-step exercises, agent implementation and Jupyter notebooks

## **Directories** ##
* **Agents/**: Python scripts for agents such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and document drafting
* **Exercises/**: Jupyter notebooks for each exercise
* **Graphs/**: Notebooks demonstrating LangGraph patterns

## **Files** ##
* **typeAnnotations.py** just shows annotations that are crucial for the lessons

*The agents are run using local models and the models folder has been excluded and it is easy to download from Hugging Face. Models used include:*
* *llama-2-7b-chat* for a bit complex tasks
* *Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4* for simple tasks
